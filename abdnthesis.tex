\begin{abstract}
This project aims to create a Filter plugin for Fluent Bit that implements additive noise \acrlong{dp}. It achieves this aim by writing a Rust-based filter plugin that's compiled to a WASM target which Fluent Bit loads. Laplacian and Gaussian mechanisms to achieve $\epsilon$-differential privacy and $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy respectfully.
\end{abstract}

\begin{acknowledgements}
I would like to acknowledge that Fluent Bit's Documentation around WASM support is reasonably exhaustive. I loosely based my filter plugin on the example Rust WASM plugin they host in their main repository. I very loosely adapted parts of their Dockerfile when writing the Fluent Bit build-stage in my own Dockerfile.
