%% For citations, I would recommend natbib for its                          
%% flexibility, particularly when named citation styles are used, but                
%% it also has useful features for plain and those of that ilk.                      
%% The natbib package gives you the following definitons

\title{Integrating Differential Privacy into Fluent Bit}
\author{Julien Leo Acker}

\school{Department of Computing Science}

%%%% In the final submission of a thesis, this should only be the year
%%%% of submission.  However, it is useful to use \date{\today} for drafts so that
%%%% they don't get mixed up.
    
\date{\today}

%% It is useful to split the document up as chapters and include
%% them.  LaTeX will sort out all the numbering and cross-referencing
%% for you --- if you run it enough times!

%% If you want to include only a couple of chapters then use the
%% \includeonly{} command with a list of the file/chapter names that
%% you wish to include.  NB, this must be in the preamble.

% \includeonly{introduction,faq}

\def\sfthing#1#2{\def#1{\mbox{{\small\normalfont\sffamily #2}}}}

\sfthing{\PP}{P}
\sfthing{\FF}{F}

%% This will make sure that all cross-references are correct (including
%% references to those file not included) but will produce a dvi
%% file with only those files/chapters you specify included.
