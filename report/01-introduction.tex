\section{Overview}




The project comprises the main application, the Rust Filter plugin itself, along with the evaluation infrastructure in able to run said plugin. The evaluation infrastructure is multifaceted: coordinated by the main Dockerfile, the filter plugin is first compiled to a WASM binary, Fluent Buit is built, the WASM is optionally pre-optimized for the architecture, the filter plugin is run with Fluent Bit that feeds it 2 sample datasets and processes it with a sample configuration, finally the results are copied over to a Jupyter Notebook container. Once the Dockerfile is built, it can be run to start up a token-authenticated web server to view the Jupiter Notebook file and associated data processing.

\section{Motivation}
With the ever-increase in data collection from 

\section{Objectives}
The primary goal of the project is to develop a WASM filter plugin for Fluent Bit that applies DP techniques to numeric data on a device level (though Fluent Bit has wide application throughout the data pipeline).
