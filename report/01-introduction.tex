Data privacy is becoming increasingly crucial in the digital age, as data breaches and misuse of personal information are on the rise. Integrating Differential Privacy (DP) into data processing pipelines like Fluent Bit can significantly enhance privacy protections. This project aims to implement a DP filter within Fluent Bit using Rust and WebAssembly (WASM), providing a novel solution to protect sensitive information in device metrics while maintaining overall data utility. This approach serves to integrate the algorithms of academia into readily deployed, industry-standard tooling for data processing.

\section{Motivation}

\section{Objectives}
The primary goal of the project is to develop a WASM filter plugin for Fluent Bit that applies DP techniques to numeric data on a device level (though Fluent Bit has wide application throughout the data pipeline).
